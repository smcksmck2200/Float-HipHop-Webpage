# HipHop Webpage
HipHop Webpage was one of the first web pages I created from the XC Academy. Our assignment was an exercise using the float CSS property. 
The float CSS propertyÂ places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. 
As a hip-hop music fanatic this is what I envisioned.
